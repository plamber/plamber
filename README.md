# Hi, I'm Patrick 👋 🏊🚴🏃 💻
Hi! I'm the CEO and tech lead at EasyLife 365 AG, a Swiss company where we create awesome SaaS solutions for the Microsoft stack. My journey started as a .NET software developer in 2002, and since 2005, I’ve been all about Microsoft tech. From SharePoint to Microsoft 365, I’ve been focused on making collaboration smoother and better.

Over the years, I've done a mix of consultancy and development, and since 2020, I've zeroed in on building SaaS solutions. I was honored to be a Microsoft MVP for SharePoint and later for Microsoft 365 development for 10 years, and I've had the chance to speak at many conferences around Europe.

My skills? I'm all about the Microsoft 365 collaboration stack and customizations. Lately, I’ve been diving into Azure, Microsoft Graph, GitHub, and DevOps, keeping our solutions cutting-edge and effective.

I studied computer science, which set the stage for my tech journey. At EasyLife 365, our goal is simple: grow as a top SaaS provider and make collaboration easier and more efficient for everyone.

I’m passionate about tech and always looking for ways to make our solutions better. Let's connect if you're into making work life easier with great tech!
